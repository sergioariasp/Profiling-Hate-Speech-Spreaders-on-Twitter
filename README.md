# Profiling-Hate-Speech-Spreaders-on-Twitter
Hate speech is defined as a public speech that expresses hate or promote violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation, between many others. Unfortunately, the emergence of social networks makes this type of speeches easier and faster to spread making it essential to develop algorithms and detect some common characteristics to prevent them and act in time. The main goal of this project used as Master thesis is to explore different machine learning and deep learning techniques for the Natural Language Processing task of handling hate speech spreaders in social media, more specifically on Twitter, as a first step towards preventing hate speech from being propagated among online users.
